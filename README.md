This is a Console App
This program has List of strings of Url paths.
Program will loop throgh each Url and after processing display the following.
Scheme
Authority
Host
Port
Query
Fragment
program has methods to process url string and return the required Parts of the Url.
the methods are all custom methods Program is not using any MicroSoft Object Like URI.

How could I access the different parts of the path
How could I get access to individual query properties? 
How will you handle URI encoded information

I think above questions have been answered in my Program the Program is saving above data in object 
that could be used to handle different parts of Url.
